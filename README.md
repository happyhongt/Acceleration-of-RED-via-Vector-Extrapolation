# Acceleration-of-RED-via-Vector-Extrapolation

Demonstration of the image restoration experiments conducted in T. Hong, Y. Romano, and M. Elad, "Acceleration of RED via Vector Extrapolation" [arXiv https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02158.pdf] We propose one accelerated technique called Vector Extrapolation (RED) for RED, see the details in our paper .

This software is used to reproduce our results shown in the following paper: 
 and is highly depend on the original RED code, see https://github.com/google/RED.
